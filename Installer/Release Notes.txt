MySQL for Excel 1.2.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.2.0

* Added support for edition of MySQL Workbench connections right from the Welcome Panel where
  connections are shown. Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections can be right-clicked
  and a new "Edit Connection" context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench
  connection properties. There is no longer a need to have MySQL Workbench installed in order
  to edit an existing connection.
* Added support for optimistic updates to Edit Data operations via a configurable option, using
  optimistic updates will ensure that pushing changes in the current editing session does not
  overwrite changes done by another person to the set of data retrieved initially. This option
  can be set globally for all editing sessions open by the current user which is persisted in the
  settings file, or for a specific editing session so when the session is over the optimistic
  update value is reset to the global one.
* Changes done to the Advanced Options dialogues for Import, Export and Append Data forms are now
  immediately reflected without requiring to close and reopen those forms.
* Added "Preview SQL statements before they are sent to the server" and "Show executed SQL statements
  along with their results" global options. The first option lets users preview the SQL statements
  used in an Export, Append or Edit data operation before they are sent to the MySQL server and edit
  them if needed. The second option lets users apply the statements directly and show the executed
  SQL statements after they were applied along with the results of the operations.
* Added "Allow to save active editing sessions" global option. This allows to save Edit sessions
  when saving the Excel workbook, and restoring them when the workbook is opened again.
* Added the "Create an Excel table for the imported MySQL table data" option to the Import Data
  dialog's advanced options to automatically create an Excel table object for every MySQL table
  imported to Excel so it can be used for Excel data analysis. Additionally the user can override the
  default style for the Excel table and choose one of the available styles within a drop down list.
* Added a new informational label "Schema:" to the panel "Select a Database Object" that shows the
  name of the current schema, located just below the "User:" and "IP:" labels.
* Fixed code that was not detecting an Excel row deletion but instead was detecting an Excel row
  change during an Edit Data operation.


MySQL for Excel 1.1.2 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.2

* Upon saving a Workbook containing Worksheets in Edit Mode, the user is asked if he
  wants to exit the Edit Mode on all Worksheets before their parent Workbook is saved
  so the Worksheets are saved unprotected, otherwise the Worksheets will remain protected
  and the users will be able to unprotect them later retrieving the passkeys from the
  application log after closing MySQL for Excel.
* Added background coloring to the column names header row of an Import Data operation
  to have the same look as the one in an Edit Data operation (i.e. gray-ish background).
* Expired passwords are checked upon connection and can be reset by the users right at
  connection time within the add-in.
* A connection test is done before doing any operation against the MySQL Server (schema
  creation, data export, append, import and edition).
* Added global options to override the default connection and query execution timeouts.
* Connection passwords can be stored securely just like MySQL Workbench does and these
  secured passwords are shared with Workbench in the same way connections are.
* Fixed bug where a backslash was inserted before apostrophes when editing a MySQL table.
* Fixed problem specific to Excel 2013 where the add-in side bar was not visible on Excel
  windows different than the first window opened.
* Fixed problem where users different to the one that installed MySQL for Excel could not
  see and use the add-in (i.e. the add-in was only installed for the current user and not
  for all users).
* Fixed problem where a failed connection was always stating that the connection password
  was wrong, now the actual failing reason for the connection failure is shown.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).


MySQL for Excel 1.1.1 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.1

* Added About dialog so users can check the MySQL for Excel version right from the Welcome panel.
* Fixed formatting of decimal numbers for European users where the decimal separator is a ",".
* Fixed formatting of data on Excel cells that had data previously imported on them.
* Other bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).
	

MySQL for Excel 1.1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.1.0

* Edit MySQL Data
	This may be the coolest feature so far; users will be able to edit the data in a
	MySQL table using MS Excel in a very friendly and intuitive way.  Edit Data supports
	inserting new rows, deleting existing rows and updating existing data as easy as playing
	with data in an Excel’s spreadsheet and pushing changes back to the server.
* Bug fixes (for a complete list refer to the CHANGES file).
	
Known Issues
--------------------
* The Edit Data does not lock records and does not update data in an optimistic way, so if
  data has changed by another user in the table being edited after it was pulled for edition
  it will be overwritten with the latest change.


MySQL for Excel 1.0.7 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.0.7

* Windows Authentication is now working for both proxy & non proxy scenarios,
  for proxy use the SQL receipt like this:
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 
	'machine\\\\user1=foo_user' 
	create user foo_user identified by 'pass' 
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'foo_user'@'%' 
	grant proxy on foo_user to myuser1 

  while for non proxy use a SQL receipt like this
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 'myuser1, Administrators'
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'myuser1'@'%'
  where myuser1 is supposed to be a member of the Windows Administrators group.
   
  In both cases you should be able to connect, Excel addin will still ask for the password, 
  just leave it blank.


MySQL for Excel 1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.0

MySQL For Excel provides the following features:
* Integrates seamlessly with Excel 2007 and 2010
* Uses the MySQL Workbench connections you have already established
* Allows importing of data from MySQL into Excel spreadsheets
* Allows appending of Excel data onto existing MySQL tables
* Allows exporting of Excel data into new MySQL tables

Known Issues
--------------------
* Seamless sync of Workbench connections is not working in this release.  
  The connections you make in MySQL for Excel will not be available in Workbench.
* Export Data dialog's preview grid can truncate some column names
* Connections cannot be edited currently.  Please use MySQL Workbench to edit your connections
* Export Data dialog can change the name of an autoadded primary key when changing first row checkbox
* Windows Authentication only works with a proxy user, for example:
	the following script can be used to implement proxy scenario: 
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 
	'machine\\\\user1=foo_user' 
	create user foo_user identified by 'pass' 
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'foo_user'@'%' 
	grant proxy on foo_user to myuser1 

Then, from MySql Excel addin, a connection can be created/opened by 
@ specifying user "myuser1" and no password (assuming windows current user is 
machine\\user1).
