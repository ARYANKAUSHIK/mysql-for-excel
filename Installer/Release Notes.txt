MySQL for Excel 1.0 Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for MySQL for Excel 1.0

MySQL For Excel provides the following features:
* Integrates seamlessly with Excel 2007 and 2010
* Uses the MySQL Workbench connections you have already established
* Allows importing of data from MySQL into Excel spreadsheets
* Allows appending of Excel data onto existing MySQL tables
* Allows exporting of Excel data into new MySQL tables

Known Issues
--------------------
* Seamless sync of Workbench connections is not working in this release.  
  The connections you make in MySQL for Excel will not be available in Workbench.
* Export Data dialog's preview grid can truncate some column names
* Connections cannot be edited currently.  Please use MySQL Workbench to edit your connections
* Export Data dialog can change the name of an autoadded primary key when changing first row checkbox
* Windows Authentication only works with a proxy user, for example:
	the following script can be used to implement proxy scenario: 
	CREATE USER myuser1 IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_windows as 
	'machine\\\\user1=foo_user' 
	create user foo_user identified by 'pass' 
	grant all privileges on *.* to 'foo_user'@'%' 
	grant proxy on foo_user to myuser1 

Then, from MySql Excel addin, a connection can be created/opened by 
@ specifying user "myuser1" and no password (assuming windows current user is 
machine\\user1).
