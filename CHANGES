1.1.1
- Added code to check for changes on the contents of the currently selected Excel cells, so if the contents become empty the Export and Append data actions are
  disabled in the same way as they are disabled when a new cells selection is made and they contain no data.
  (Bug #16495151 - EXPORT TABLE LINK IS NOT DISABLED WHEN DATA IS DELETED)
- Added code to clear the format of a target Excel range where MySQL data is to be imported to before copying the values to the Excel range so the format applied
  to the Excel cells from a previous import operation does not corrupt the format of newly imported data.
  (Bug #16495155 - DATA GETS CORRUPTED WHEN CELL FORMAT IS DIFFERENT THAN DATA EXPORTED)
- Fixed logic that detects data types for columns to check for empty columns instead of excluded ones and properly assigning the default generic data type of
  varchar(255) to empty columns as per design. (Bug #16495493 - EXPORT DATA - DATA TYPE FOR EMPTY COLUMNS IS NOT AUTO-DETECTED)
- Fixed code that detected data types for columns for the scenario where only 1 row of Excel data is selected for Export or for Append, in which case the data
  type was always being set as a varchar(255) which is used when data types between rows are not consistent. (Bug #16493139 - AUTOMATIC MAPPING NOT WORKING)
- Added a parameter to the LoadConnections method that refreshes connections from its corresponding file, set to true when the the Refresh Connections action
  is performed. (Bug #16493129 - CONNECTION DETAILS NOT REFRESHED)
- Added code to prevent the connections, schemas and DB objects lists from drawing while they are being filled with items.
  (Bug #16392862 - CONNECTIONS LIST FLICKERS WHEN A CONNECTION IS DELETED OR ADDED)
- Added performance_schema to the list of system schemas, so now it shows along with the mysql and information_schema schemas list.
  (Bug #16473033 - PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA NOT LISTED UNDER "SYSTEM SCHEMAS" GROUP)
- Added code that converts numbers to invariant culture strings when building the SQL statements used to push queries to the MySQL Server.
  (MySql bug #67663, Bug #15903921 - USING MYSQL FOR EXCEL IN FRANCE)
- Refactored code in Panels (AutoStyleableBasePanel.cs, DBObjectSelectionPanel.cs, SchemaSelectionPanel.cs, WelcomePanel.cs), in TaskPanelControl.cs and in 
  some Forms (ExportForm.cs, ImportTableViewForm.cs) to comply with StyleCop rules.
- Removed code that always forced the FirstDisplayedScrollingColumnIndex of the preview grid to the currently selected column every time the First Row Contains
  Column Names checkbox is checked or unchecked. (Bug #16419402 - EXPORT DATA FREEZES WHEN SWITCHING HEADERS ROW)
- Set the CreateIndex property value in each new column to be exported immediately after the column data type's is auto-detected.
  (Bug #16238445 - EXPORT DATA - CREATE INDEX CHECKBOX IS NOT AUTO-CHECKED ON DATATYPE DETECTION)
- Moved logic that handles Table and Column values and warnings from Export Form (frontend) to MySQLDataTable and MySQLDataColumn classes (backend).
  (Bug #16397637 - EXPORT DATA - FOCUS GOES TO FIRST COLUMN WHEN EXCLUDING ANY OTHER COLUMN)
- Added code to expand each of the connection group nodes after they are initialized with existing connections.
  (Bug #16238782 - REMOTE CONNECTIONS SHOULD BE EXPANDED ON THE WELCOME PANEL)
- The context menu opened by right-clicking the preview grid in the Import Data Form is now showing context menu actions depending on the number of selected columns
  as follows:
    Select All: Visible when # of selected columns < total columns
    Select None: Visible when # of selected columns > 0
  (Bug #16238663 - IMPORT DATA - CONTEXT MENU SHOULD SMARTLY SHOW SELECT ACTIONS)
- Removed the code that disabled the whole preview grid when the Import Form was used within an Edit Data operation, the disabling of the preview grid was disabling
  the horizontal scrollbar as well. Now the grid is not disabled but columns selection in the grid is cancelled when the Import Form is used by Edit Data which was
  the original intention since in Edit Data all columns must be imported to the worksheet. Disabled the context menu for the grid as well in this scenario.
  (Bug #16239011 - EDIT DATA - IMPORT DIALOG'S PREVIEW GRID HAS HORIZONTAL SCROLLBAR DISABLED)
- Added a link in the Welcome Panel to open an About box displaying the MySQLfor Excel version and copyright text. The About box can be closed by clicking on it or
  pressing the ESC key.(Bug #16238860 - MYSQL FOR EXCEL VERSION NOT VISIBLE UNLESS GOING TO ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS)

  1.1.0
- Added Edit MySQL Data feature: users are now able to edit the data in a MySQL table using MS Excel in a very friendly and intuitive way. Edit Data supports
  inserting new rows, deleting existing rows and updating existing data as easy as playing with data in an Excel’s spreadsheet and pushing changes back to the server.
- Enabled the following checkboxes in the Append Data's Advanced Options dialog and added code in the Append Data dialog to use the checkboxes as follows:
  * Automatically store the column mapping for the given table
    - If checked the current mapping will be stored automatically after clicking the Append button if the append operation is successful and there is no mapping for
	  the current connection.schema.table already; the new mapping is stored with a proposed name of Mapping.
  * Reload stored column mapping for the selected table automatically
    - If checked the first Stored Mapping found where all column names in the source grid match all column names in the target grid is automatically selected and
	  applied when the Append Data dialog is loaded.
- Fixed code that applies a stored column mapping to skip target columns where the associated mapping is empty (saved as a -1).
- Enclosed the Add-In's startup code in a try-catch block in order to log any possible error thrown during startup; and added information messages to the log at the
  begginning of the Add-In's startup code and at the end of the shutdown code.  Also changed the wrapper method that calls the MySQLUtility to write messages to the
  log to make logging easier, thus changed the log call throughout all the code that contains a try-catch block.
- Added code to the main wix configuration file to check if a newer version is already installad and if so abort the installtion.
- Fixed code to refresh the Import Procedure Form's preview grid's data source to repaint its contents every time the Call button is pressed.
- Added code to re-pull connections after connections are migrated from Excel to Workbench.
- Fixed code so when the Append Data's Automatic Mapping is performed any subsequent change on a mapping resets the mapping to a Manual Mapping.
- Added code to the InfoDialog class to set the button text to "Show Details" or "Hide Details" depending on the status of the Details text container.
- Fixed a GUID in the main wix configuration file so now previous versions are uninstalled during a new installation.
- Added an option to the Export Data's Advanced Options dialog to remove columns with no data, by default the Export Dialog will only flag those columns as Excluded.
  Added code to display a warning and paint a column red if the column name is not set, display a warning if the table name is not set, and stack warnings but not
  display them if a column is Excluded, warnings are displayed normally for columns if they are not Excluded anymore.  Added code to prevent the Append and Export of
  Data if more than 1 selection is made (selecting more than 1 area holding the Ctrl key while selecting Excel cells).
- Fixed problem that prevented MySQL for Excel from loading when Display settings in Windows 7 is set to Adjust to Best Performance
  (Oracle bug 14521405 - UNHANDLED EXCEPTION IS THROWN WHEN LOADING MYSQL FOR EXCEL).
- Fixed code that renames the auto-generated Primary Key column when the Table name changes since it was not detecting if a column with the same name already existed
  in the table. The column duplication was not actually happening, it looked that way because the automatically generated PK column was not detecting a column had
  that same name.
- Fixed code to always set an empty string instead of null to the MySQLDataColumn properties that stores MySQL data types (MySQLDataType, RowsFrom1stDataType and
  RowsFrom2ndDataType). Added code to display a warning and color red a column which Data Type has not been set by the user or has been manually cleared.
- Added code to output to the application log exception messages consistently in all places where exceptions are catched.

1.0.7
- Changed code to conditionally detect the datatype of a column with no data in any of its cells as either a Varchar(255) when Exporting data (empty column falls back to a "safe"
  type that user can override) or as a null/empty datatype when Appending data so the empty column can be automatically mapped to any other column regardless of the target's
  column datatype. (Internal bug 35 - Append Data detects a column with no data as a varchar column which does not map to any column).
- Updated code so that when Workbench version 5.2.41 or earlier is installed and there are still no connections created in MySQL for Excel the Workbench connections are copied
  from Workbench to the MySQL for Excel connections file. (Internal bug 49 - Workbench connections are not copied to MySql for Excel).
- Updated version in AssemblyInfo to 1.0.7.
- Manage Connections action label is available in the Welcome Panel when MySQL Workbench 5.2.42 is installed.
  Database connections are shared with MySQL Workbench if version 5.2.42 or later is installed (meaning they are read from and saved to the Workbench connections file and on the
  first run of MySQL for Excel it will attempt to migrate all local connections to the Workbench connection file and delete the local connections file, otherwise they are still
  managed locally within MySQL for Excel. (Oracle bug 14368158 - CONNECTIONS CREATED IN MYSQL FOR EXCEL UNUSABLE IN WORKBENCH)
- Refactoring on TransparentPictureBox control to fix some flickering when resizing the Excel form.
  Added an upperPanel that contains all controls above the MyTreeView controls to all panels so when the form is resized to have a very small size the controls at the bottom
  actually go behind the new upperPanel so there is no overlapping at all. (Oracle bug 14406412 - OVERLAPPING CONTROLS ON ALL PANELS WHEN EXCEL WINDOW IS SMALL).
- Removed the code that reset the TaskPaneControl's height since the height can't be changed for a right-docking of the panel.
  (Oracle bug 14369568 - EXCEL WINDOW CAN'T BE RESIZED IF STARTS WITH A SMALL SIZE).
- Fixed code in custom PreviewDataViewGrid control to readjust the recalculation of the headers width when the HeaderText changes and to disable the AutoWidth feature of each
  column header when the automatically recalculated width exceeds the ColumnsMaximumWidth property. (Oracle Bug 14350168 - EXPORT DATA DIALOG'S PREVIEW GRID TRUNCATES COLUMN NAMES)
- Fixed code so now "text" columns can be automatically mapped to set or enum columns.
  Fixed code to properly change mapped column names when checking/unchecking the "First Row Contains Column Names" checkbox in the Append Data Form.
  (Oracle Bug 14370049 - THE AUTO MAPPING IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY)
- Disabled Export button when table name is empty (Oracle Bug 14389853 - EXPORT BUTTON IS ENABLED WHEN TABLE NAME IS EMPTY)
