1.0.7
- Changed code to conditionally detect the datatype of a column with no data in any of its cells as either a Varchar(255) when Exporting data (empty column falls back to a "safe"
  type that user can override) or as a null/empty datatype when Appending data so the empty column can be automatically mapped to any other column regardless of the target's
  column datatype. (Internal bug 35 - Append Data detects a column with no data as a varchar column which does not map to any column).
- Updated code so that when Workbench version 5.2.41 or earlier is installed and there are still no connections created in MySQL for Excel the Workbench connections are copied
  from Workbench to the MySQL for Excel connections file. (Internal bug 49 - Workbench connections are not copied to MySql for Excel).
- Updated version in AssemblyInfo to 1.0.7.
- Manage Connections action label is available in the Welcome Panel when MySQL Workbench 5.2.42 is installed.
  Database connections are shared with MySQL Workbench if version 5.2.42 or later is installed (meaning they are read from and saved to the Workbench connections file and on the
  first run of MySQL for Excel it will attempt to migrate all local connections to the Workbench connection file and delete the local connections file, otherwise they are still
  managed locally within MySQL for Excel. (Oracle bug 14368158 - CONNECTIONS CREATED IN MYSQL FOR EXCEL UNUSABLE IN WORKBENCH)
- Refactoring on TransparentPictureBox control to fix some flickering when resizing the Excel form.
  Added an upperPanel that contains all controls above the MyTreeView controls to all panels so when the form is resized to have a very small size the controls at the bottom
  actually go behind the new upperPanel so there is no overlapping at all. (Oracle bug 14406412 - OVERLAPPING CONTROLS ON ALL PANELS WHEN EXCEL WINDOW IS SMALL).
- Removed the code that reset the TaskPaneControl's height since the height can't be changed for a right-docking of the panel.
  (Oracle bug 14369568 - EXCEL WINDOW CAN'T BE RESIZED IF STARTS WITH A SMALL SIZE).
- Fixed code in custom PreviewDataViewGrid control to readjust the recalculation of the headers width when the HeaderText changes and to disable the AutoWidth feature of each
  column header when the automatically recalculated width exceeds the ColumnsMaximumWidth property. (Oracle Bug 14350168 - EXPORT DATA DIALOG'S PREVIEW GRID TRUNCATES COLUMN NAMES)
- Fixed code so now "text" columns can be automatically mapped to set or enum columns.
  Fixed code to properly change mapped column names when checking/unchecking the "First Row Contains Column Names" checkbox in the Append Data Form.
  (Oracle Bug 14370049 - THE AUTO MAPPING IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY)
- Disabled Export button when table name is empty (Oracle Bug 14389853 - EXPORT BUTTON IS ENABLED WHEN TABLE NAME IS EMPTY)
- Commit for Oraclebug #14521405 Unhandled exception is thrown when loading MySQL for Excel.
